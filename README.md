## üåê Microservices Architecture

Here is a visual representation of the Roboshop microservices setup:

![Roboshop Architecture](roboshop.jpg)

**Explanation of interactions:**

1. **Frontend** communicates with **Cart** and **Catalogue** services to fetch products and handle orders.  
2. **Cart** relies on **Redis** for caching and **Catalogue** for product info.  
3. **Payment** interacts with **MySQL** for storing transactions.  
4. **Shipping** listens to events from **RabbitMQ** to process deliveries.  
5. **Catalogue** service fetches product data from **MongoDB**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- ‚úÖ Automates setup of all Roboshop microservices.  
- ‚úÖ Installs dependencies: NodeJS, Python, MongoDB, MySQL, Redis, RabbitMQ.  
- ‚úÖ Creates system users and app directories.  
- ‚úÖ Configures services with systemd for auto-start.  
- ‚úÖ Loads initial database data if not present.  
- ‚úÖ Logs all actions to `/var/log/shell-roboshop`.  
- ‚úÖ Fail-safe execution with `set -euo pipefail` and error trapping.

## üöÄ Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GorleJansi/shell-roboshop.git
   cd roboshop-shell

2. Make scripts executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x *.sh


3. Run the main orchestrator (example for MongoDB services):
   ```bash
   sudo ./roboshop.sh mongodb

4. Check logs:
   ```bash
   tail -f /var/log/shell-roboshop/<script_name>.log


üîß Requirements

Linux system (CentOS/RHEL/Fedora recommended)

Root privileges

Internet connectivity for S3 artifact downloads

üìå Notes

Scripts are idempotent; re-running will skip already configured steps

Error trapping prints line number and command for easier debugging

Designed for learning and DevOps practice
